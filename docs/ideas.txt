FEATURE 1:

Step-by-step guide:

Set up the responses: We'll create a list of possible responses that the Magic 8-Ball can give.
Random selection: We'll use Python's random module to select a random response from the list.
User interaction: We'll prompt the user to ask a question and then display the random response.
Implemented in: version1.py

Enhancements:
Front-end Design: If you want to create a graphical interface, you can use libraries like Tkinter for Python.
Additional Features: You could add more complex logic, animations, or even sound effects to enhance the user experience.
This basic implementation will give you a functional Magic 8-Ball game that you can play in the console. Have fun coding and feel free to expand on this idea!

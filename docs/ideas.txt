---------------------------
FEATURE 1 - Implemented in: version1.py

Step-by-step guide:

Set up the responses: We'll create a list of possible responses that the Magic 8-Ball can give.
Random selection: We'll use Python's random module to select a random response from the list.
User interaction: We'll prompt the user to ask a question and then display the random response.

Enhancements:
Front-end Design: If you want to create a graphical interface, you can use libraries like Tkinter for Python.
Additional Features: You could add more complex logic, animations, or even sound effects to enhance the user experience.

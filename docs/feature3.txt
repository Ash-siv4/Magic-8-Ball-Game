create the project with a python backend
---------------------------
FEATURE 3:
To create a Magic 8-Ball project with a Python backend, we can use a web framework like Flask. Flask will handle the backend logic and serve the responses, while the frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s how you can set up the project:

Step 1: Set Up the Flask Backend
- Install Flask: First, you need to install Flask. You can do this using pip: pip install flask
- Create the Flask App: Create a file named app.py for the Flask backend.
- Run the Flask App: Run the Flask app by executing the following command in your terminal:


Step 2: Create the Frontend
- HTML Structure: Create an index.html file.
- CSS Styling: Create a styles.css file.
- JavaScript Logic: Create a script.js file.

Step 3: Serve the Frontend with Flask
To serve the static files (HTML, CSS, and JS) with Flask, update the app.py file to include routes for serving these files.
Move your index.html, styles.css, and script.js files into a folder named static within your project directory.


Directory Structure
Your project directory should look like this:
/magic-8-ball
│
├── app.py
└── static
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    └── script.js


Running the Project
- Start your Flask server by running python app.py.
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
- You should see the Magic 8-Ball web app. Type a question and click "Shake" to get a response.

This setup creates a full-stack web application with a Python Flask backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The backend handles the logic of generating a random response, while the frontend provides the user interface.

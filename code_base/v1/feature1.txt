Magic 8-Ball
>> 
A magic 8-ball game uses simple programming logic, which makes it one of the most fun and engaging coding projects for beginners. The 8-ball should display a different message every time someone shakes it. So as a developer, you’re looking to associate a particular text string with a variable, and then randomly pick a particular variable every time a user shakes the ball. It’s quite easy to implement and it can be fun to play around with the front-end design.
---------------------------
FEATURE 1:
Creating a Magic 8-Ball game is a great beginner programming project! Let's walk through the basic steps to implement this using Python. The concept involves generating a random response each time a user "shakes" the ball.

Here's a step-by-step guide:
- Set up the responses: We'll create a list of possible responses that the Magic 8-Ball can give.
- Random selection: We'll use Python's random module to select a random response from the list.
- User interaction: We'll prompt the user to ask a question and then display the random response.

Implemented in: version1.py


Explanation:
- Import the random module: This module will help us randomly select a response from our list.
- Define the responses: These are the possible answers the Magic 8-Ball can give.
- Main function magic_8_ball():
    - We use a while loop to continuously prompt the user for a question.
    - The user can type a question or 'quit' to exit the loop.
    - A random response is selected using random.choice(responses) and printed out.
- Run the function: This ensures that the magic_8_ball function runs when the script is executed.


Enhancements:
- Front-end Design: If you want to create a graphical interface, you can use libraries like Tkinter for Python.
- Additional Features: You could add more complex logic, animations, or even sound effects to enhance the user experience.

This basic implementation will give you a functional Magic 8-Ball game that you can play in the console. Have fun coding and feel free to expand on this idea!

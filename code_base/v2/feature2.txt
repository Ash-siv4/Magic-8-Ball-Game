recreate the above with an interactive frontend
---------------------------
FEATURE 2:
Creating an interactive frontend for the Magic 8-Ball game can be done using various web technologies. Here, I'll demonstrate how to build a simple web-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Step 1: Set Up HTML
Create an index.html file for the basic structure of the webpage.


Step 2: Add Some Styling with CSS
Create a styles.css file to style the webpage.


Step 3: Implement the Logic with JavaScript
Create a script.js file to handle the logic for shaking the Magic 8-Ball and displaying the response.


Explanation:
HTML Structure:
- A text input for the user to type their question.
- A button to trigger the shakeBall function.
- A div to display the response from the Magic 8-Ball.

CSS Styling:
- Basic styling to center the content and make it visually appealing.

JavaScript Logic:
- An array of possible responses.
- The shakeBall function:
    - Checks if the user has typed a question.
    - Selects a random response from the array.
    - Displays the response in the designated div.


Putting It All Together
When you open the index.html file in a web browser, you will see an interactive Magic 8-Ball game. You can type a question into the input box, click the "Shake" button, and see a random response appear.

This simple project can be expanded with more advanced features, such as animations or additional styling, but it provides a great starting point for beginners to learn about web development and JavaScript programming.
